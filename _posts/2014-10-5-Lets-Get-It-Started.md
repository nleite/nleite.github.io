So yes, I've decided to get my self doing some blogging about technology that I'm familiar with _(shocking, another IT guy blog post!)_ so you can expect lots of [MongoDB](http://www.mongodb.org), stories from the field of [Solutions Architecting](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solutions_Architect) and other topics that I might find interesting or worthy to write about.

###Motivation

I'm very fortunate to work in a company that has from the most interesting and bright minds you can find on IT. Among those we can find [Asya Kamsky](http://askasya.com/about), [Richard Kreuter](http://www.mongodb.com/content/richard-kreuter), [Antoine Gribal](http://edgystuff.tumblr.com/), [Christain Kvalheim](http://christiankvalheim.com/), [Henrik Ingo](http://openlife.cc/blog) and so many others that it's just too long to put them all in this post. 

Among those one can find [Jesse Jiryu Davis](http://emptysqua.re/blog/) who wrote this [brillant piece](http://emptysqua.re/blog/write-an-excellent-programming-blog/) about writing programing blog's, better saying, excelent programing blog. The message I got out of it is that one can improve, not only the code that he writes, but also his understanding of one's work if we write about it. Writing has this gorgeous side effect, forces you to think about what you are writing! Which in turn helps you to reflect and improve. Also writing is sharing, and sharing is truly a magnificent humble effort of communicating one's self. And that is cool!

###Modus Operandi

My intention is to post regularly, short and clear articles that I find interesting to me and others. I promise not to pollute too much my _web presence_ and **the internet** while doing so.

PS - I'm not a fan of the The Black Eyed Peas but this music comes on just fine.
