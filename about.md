Howdy stranger, 

There are more than 2 possible reasons why you ended it in this blog but let's keep it with the obvious ones:

1. You know me! So no need to introduce myself
2. You don't know me and google made it so we could finally meet!

If you are in the latest of the 2 options where's what you want to know:

* Norberto Leite
* Software Engineer
* Work for [MongoDB](http://www.mongodb.com)
* Write about tech and other professional topics
* Love python, beer and football (not necessarily on that order)

### Why do I keep a blog?

I have a job that allows me to meet a lot of people and more often than not they make me questions or raise topics that I find very interesting. Although I don't disclose their names or any sensitive info, I like to share my findings around those with the general public (a.k.a "das internet"). 
You will find lots of different articles written in different languages ... just because.

### Feel free to reach out
